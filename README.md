# TidalTAMU-Hack-A-Thon-Projected-Grades

The following project was made at a Texas A&M Hack-A-Thon sponsored by Phillips 66 and the 
Texas A&M Institute of Data Science. The prompt we were given is the following: 

Develop a project to provide unique insights in the field of education using data science and/or
machine learning to increase student/teacher engagement and productivity. If applicable, integrate 
your findings into an application or website that achieves the end goal. 

We were also given the option of using the following dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/students-performance

Our project comprised of using linear regression models in order to accurately predict a students
future score on a upcoming test, by examing their study habits, and their scores on previous tests.
We used the data sets that was provided and integrated machine learning to do so.
